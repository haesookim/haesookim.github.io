<p style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px">Hi. I'm Haesoo Kim ðŸ˜Ž</p>

<!-- Me as a Person -->
<p>
	My friends like to describe me as a serial enthusiast - my most defining characteristic is the
	enthusiasm I show to most of the things I love. Be it research, friends, music, games; I don't
	do things halfway. That's probably why I enjoy being in research so much, since in its essence
	it's an endeavor in going to extra lengths to get answers to the things you're curious about.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Why study HCI?</strong> I've always been interested in viewing the world through the diverse lenses of various disciplines. I've also been perpetually interested in 'people', and how each individual has their own perspective and story to share. This led me to activities that allowed me to dive into the stories of the people around us, such as Humans of SNU, LAS and others.
</p>

<p>
	I'm also a firm believer in helping people, as well as making the world a better place.
