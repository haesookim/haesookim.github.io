	<div>Hi. I'm Haesoo KimðŸŒŠ</div>
	<p>
		I'm a Master's student at KAIST School of Computing, and currently a member of
		<a href="https://www.kixlab.org/">KIXLAB</a>. I'm part of the interdisciplinary track
		organized by the School of Computing and the Humanities & Social Sciences Department, and am
		being co-advised by <a href="https://juhokim.com/">Prof. Juho Kim</a> and
		<a href="https://hss.kaist.ac.kr/boards/view/fulltime_professor_en/77"
			>Prof. Jeong-woo Jang.</a

	</p>
	<p>
		My research interests are focused on <strong>Human-Computer Interaction</strong>,
		specifically around social media and how people utilize and interpret such systems. Other
		interests include interactive narratives, accessible computing, AI/tech ethics, and fandom
		studies.
	</p>
	<p>
		Outside of research, I spend my free time reading, singing, playing games and obsessing over
		something or another.
