			<p style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px">Hi. I'm Haesoo Kim 😎</p>
			<p>
				I'm currently working on my Ph.D in Information Science at Cornell University, member of the
				<a href="https://socialmedialab.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Social Media Lab</a> led by
				<a href="https://cals.cornell.edu/natalie-bazarova" target="_blank"
					>Prof. Natalie Bazarova</a
				>.
			</p>
			<p>
				My research interests are focused on <strong>online social interactions</strong>,
				specifically around social media. My interest lies in the interesction of exploring
				antisocial behavior, risks, and negative experiences in online spaces, and how they
				intersect with individuals' self-expression, exploration, and community building. My main
				focus is on how people explore and express aspects of the self through online spaces,
				despite or in spite of these risks. Other interests include digital literacy & education,
				interactive narratives, accessibility, AI/tech ethics, and fandom studies.
			</p>
			<p>
				Previously, I earned Bachelor's degrees in <strong>Computer Science & Engineering</strong>,
				<strong>Psychology</strong>, and <strong>Information Science & Culture</strong> at Seoul
				National University College of Liberal Studies. I also have a Master's degree at KAIST
				School of Computing, co-advised by
				<a href="https://juhokim.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Juho Kim</a> and
				<a href="https://hss.kaist.ac.kr/boards/view/fulltime_professor_en/77" target="_blank"
					>Prof. Jeong-woo Jang</a
				>
				as a member of <a href="https://www.kixlab.org/" target="_blank">KIXLAB</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Outside of research, I spend my free time swing dancing, reading, singing, or obsessing over
				something or another. I also really enjoy trying new things! 😉
